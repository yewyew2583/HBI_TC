Each solution hase different IO mapping and setups.
In AEM, currently TC has variations as 
					Alpha TC, 
					DebugStation TC, 
					DebugCart Cell TC, 
					SLTC_POC.
					SLTC_CX16.

Inorder to run in related TC module, please select the solution file accordingly.

HBI_TC.sln		:For HBI TC (Alpha)
HBI_DFC_TC.sln		:For HBI DebugCart FullCellStack IPC (Degub Cart)
HBI_DSTN_TC.sln		:For HBI DebugCart DebugStation IPC  (Degub Cart)
HBI_SLTC_POC.sln		:For SLTC_POC	(AEM INTERNAL Testing Machine)
HBI_SLTC.sln 		:For SLTC_CX16	(AEM INTERNAL Testing Machine)

Simulation:
HBI_TC_Sim.sln		:For All TC (For Simulation but All IO modules are disable) //Since IO are disable, It can be use as Simulation for All version!
